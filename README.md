## Description

This project combines a few really awesome open source projects to bring state-of-the-art GPT-based persona simulation to your web project. Simply, it provides a way to capture voice activity, convert it into base64 encoded text, and send it to the Carter /chat endpoint. Your Carter character will then respond as if you had sent it text input!
